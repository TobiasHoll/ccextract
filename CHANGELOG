1.1                                                                 (15.10.2013)
    - Now uses more detailed information (e.g. whether a phone number is a
        mobile number or for a fax machine) from the ABMultiValue tables. This
        also allows distinguishing different parts of an address.
    - Now supports more information, such as
      - other anniversaries / dates except birthdays
      - related people (e.g. parents)
    - Bugfix regarding -l/--loglevel options (it would previously fail)
    - Bugfix regarding the SQL queries (errors would occur, if there were many
        entries or entries with many items (e.g. phone numbers))
